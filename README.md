Preliminary Exercise for LearnCrunch Synthetic Data Course

These are the solutions for the preliminary exercise for the LearnCrunch Synthetic Data Course.

Please note that I used the Earth-Venus distance time series rather than the Dublin tide data for the Monte Carlo simulations.  
Also, I limited the Monte Carlo simulations to 10,0000 repititions rather than 1 million as stated in the problem set.
